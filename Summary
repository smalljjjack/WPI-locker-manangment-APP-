# WPI-locker-manangment-APP-
Java app development

I did this Android Application in 2017 Spring for the MIS 571 Database develop application course final project. 

This program is for helping WPI gym administrator manage the gym lockers. It stores all user, locker and administrator's information in
Database. I applied SQLite as the model construct the Database.
